For the following challenges, you are going to use MongoDB to store data. To simplify the configuration, you'll use a service called MongoDB Atlas.
Create a MongoDB Atlas account

MongoDB Atlas is a MongoDB Database-as-a-Service platform, which means that they configure and host the database for you. 
Then, your only responsibility will be to populate your database with what matters: data.

    Go here to sign up for a new MongoDB Atlas account.
    Fill the registration form with your information and click Sign up.

Create a new cluster

    On the next page, fill in your organization's name, project's name, select JavaScript as your preferred programming language, 
    and click the green Continue button.
    Click the Create a cluster button under Shared Clusters. This should be the only free option.
    In the Cloud Provider & Region dropdown, leave this as the default (typically AWS).
    In the Cluster Tier dropdown, leave this as the default, M0 Sandbox (Shared RAM, 512 MB Storage).
    In the Cluster Name dropdown, you can give your cluster a name, or leave it as the default, Cluster 0.
    Click the green Create Cluster button at the bottom of the screen.
    You should now see the message Your cluster is being created. New clusters take between 1-3 minutes to provision. 
    Wait until the cluster is created before going to the next step.

Create a new user for the database

    On the left side of screen, click on Database Access.
    Click the green Add New Database User button.
    In the modal, enter a new username and password.
    Under Database User Privileges, leave this as the default option, Read and write to any database.
    Click the Add User button to create your new user.

Allow access from all IP addresses

    On the left side of the screen, click on Network Access.
    Click the green Add IP Address button.
    In the modal, click the ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE button. You should see 0.0.0.0/0 in the Access List Entry entry field.
    Click the green Confirm button.

Connect to your cluster

    Click on the green Get Started button in the bottom left of your screen should now show you the final step, Connect to your cluster, click on it.
    On the left side of the screen, click on Clusters.
    Click the Connect button for your cluster.
    In the popup modal, click on Connect your application.
    You should see the URI you'll use to connect to your database similar to this: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/<db-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority.
    Click the Copy button to copy your URI to your clipboard.

Notice that the <username>, <cluster-name>, and <db-name> fields of URI you copied are already filled out for you. All you need to do is replace the <password> field with the one you created in the previous step.

And that's it â€” you now have the URI to add to your application and connect to your database. Keep this URI safe somewhere so you can use it later.
